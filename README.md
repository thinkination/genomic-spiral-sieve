Genomic medicine is the eventual future of intelligent healing. It could find cures for diseases which our current generation of humans thought was not curable.

#Introduction

Living organisms tend to have a DNA.

A DNA is made of a long running chain of [nucleotides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide). Often this is addressed as [DNA Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence).

The following image is a textual representation of how a DNA sequence looks like:

#Problem

These DNA sequences are really long. Comparing two DNAs or finding a sub-sequence of disease causing sequence in a person's DNA takes too much time.

#Solution

In Information theory, there is a concept of compression.

There are two basic types of information compression:

1. [Loss-less compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression)

1. [Lossy Compression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression)

The well known ZIP file is just application of Loss-Less compression algorithm on a given file to reduce its size on file system without losing any data.

This is the first step of Genomic Spiral Sieve is to compress the DNA sequences without any loss.

# What is Genomic Spiral Seive

Genome - is a sequence of nucleotides - A T G C.
Spiral Sieves - are mathematical systems that give out numbers of a specific pattern.

Genomic Spiral Seive is a system which provides a compressed analysis mechanism for quick operations on a large DNA sequences using information compression techniques.
